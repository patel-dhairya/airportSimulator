<b> Airport Simulator Project </b>

Welcome to the Airport Simulator project! üõ´‚úàÔ∏è

I've always been fascinated by the intricate workings of airport systems, efficiently managing numerous flights amid various challenges. This project is my attempt to create a simulation game that allows users to experience the complexities of handling an airport. <br><br>
It is Java-based simulation project which uses important java functionalities and makes use of JavaFX for GUI (which is currently only available in my local pc as I am still testing <i>airport.java</i> class on local level.)

<br>

<b> Current Working Flow </b>:<br>
An air traffic controller records an incoming flight entering airport airspace,
and requesting to land at the airport, by submitting its flight number. As long as the
plane has previously registered with the airport, the air traffic controller is given an
unoccupied runway number on which the plane will have permission to land. If all
runways are occupied however, this permission is denied and the air traffic controller
is informed to instruct the plane to circle the airport. If the plane has not
previously registered with the airport an error is signalled.

<b> Key Features: </b>

* Java-based simulation leveraging essential Java functionalities.
* Implementation of JavaFX for a visually engaging GUI (currently in the testing phase on my local machine).

<b> Work in Progress: </b> <br>
Project is still work in progress. Please don't download at present moment as multiple files are not pushed to main repo for testing and compatibility check reasons. I am currently on vacation so project will likely updated next week (20th Nov, 2023)
